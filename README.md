## app-router gh-pages
The code that powers the demo page [erikringsmuth.github.io/app-router](http://erikringsmuth.github.io/app-router). This is a great example of an `app-router` setup.

Note: You'll notice that links use relative paths starting in `../`. This is because gh-pages adds `/app-router/` to the begining of every path. Relative paths allow gh-pages to be run locally without `/app-router/`.
